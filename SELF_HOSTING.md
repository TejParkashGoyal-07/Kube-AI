# Self-Hosting Graphite

Full self-hosting capability is on the roadmap for Graphite. The only online dependency left are the AI models currently served by [Replicate](https://replicate.com).

In the meantime, you can run Graphite locally for development purposes. To do so, follow the steps detailed in the [Development Environment](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-environment) section of the contributing guide.
